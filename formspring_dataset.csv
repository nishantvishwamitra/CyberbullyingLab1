Q: Which is your favourite movie of all time? and your favourite scene in it?<br>A: Hmmm  If you asked me this question a year ago  then I would have said &quot;The Descent&quot;  hands down! It was a horror film  but it had so many aspects of those traditional horror films  it wasn't just relying on blood and gore to bring the viewers in (obviously it had that too)  but it was more than the recent horror that is being made...So anyway  I loved it until the second one came out  and it just didn't flow as well as the first  and it didn't make the plot go anywhere. If anything  it went slightly backwards  only because it cleared up things from the first one  that would have been nice left to the imagination... :(	0

Q: dream car/bike/van?<br>A: HAHA! Your answer to this question made me laugh! The car that I really wanted  (before I settled with mine) was a 5 dr Toyota Rav 4 :P In light metallic blue with grey bumpers! Made me laugh that we wanted the same one lol!  So anyway  my dream car  do you mean affordable or in a dream world? I will say both :) If money wasn't an option  I would probably choose something like a porshe Carrera GT Cabriolet  only because <333333333 But in the real world  I am happy to say I own my dream car :D A New Beetle Cabriolet. I have it in light metallic blue and have blue and white flowers/birds down the side. If I could change the colour  I would. I LOVEEEEEEE the dark metallic navy one  with the cream leather. I would actually jizz if I ever bought one like that! LOL! It costed me just over u00a37 000 and that was a lot of money for me having just turned 19  but I saved up and managed to get it :) The insurance is a bitch though  but luckily its fairly economical to run :) I also really wanted to own a Jeep Wrangler Golden Eagle in Black  but they came out last year I think  and its far too much money for me to spend on a car. Besides  they devalue really easily  and rust quite badly :(	0

Q: what is your style?<br>A: My style? You mean with hair  make-up  clothing etc? Shall I answer all? lol So hair style  i'm not one of those people who like their hair to look perfect all the time. On occasion  yeah I like to style it but im not anal about it being perfect. I absolutely LOVE messy hair  so I use the natural wave thats in my hair  to create a messy and  kind of bed-head look. I use more hairspray than I probably should  but I like the end effect :) My make-up style  I prefer a natural make-up look for daytime  for example a little eyeliner and gold tone eye shadows. For evening or clubs (depending on my clothing) I LOVE a black smokey eye look (only when its done properly) so I might do something with dark eyeshadows and black makeup  but keep a natural base and nude lips. My clothing...well...do you have a year? lol I don't really go by what things say in magazines or in the fashion world at all. I like to wear what I want  and I don't give a shit if anyone else doesn't like it. I suppose in Skins sense (to refer it to someone) I wear a lot of Effy kind of inspired clothes (slashes  white/black  chains etc) but I like to mix it with different prints and/or colours. Imagine a mix of Effy  Naomi and Emily  and you have my kind of style lol. I once wore my satin dressing gown out as a jacket LOL! It was to a Skins House Party actually  and its blue and a floral pattern  you may have seen it :) So all in all  fuck other people  look how you want to look :)	0

Ohh no. Its out of our control.r &amp;&amp; I guess the inhumane way of growing all our food supplies is something to overlook as well. Only being that the animals literally cant think  move  do anything ut produce giagantic chicken breasts and stand in their own poop their entire life till the stock yards. Sooo its way out of our hands for that as well. r All these things need to be asked to our 'Oh SO lets make a change' president because the way I see it  theres no changes only what the government cares about is what is necessary. and that is wrong.	0

Q: The children living next door are being horribly abused by their parents. The only way to stop the abuse is to adopt the children and care for them in your home. Would you?<br>A: thats really a hard question. and to be honest i dont think i could care for the amount of children that are being abused and self sacrifice my entire life for them. thats really harsh and makes me sound awful but that exact senario is happening next to my parents house and when i was about 18 i thought that is something i would have been willing to do but now i see them and how far they are that it would almost be mear unfair and unsuccessful on my part for them. its all they know. and if the state wont do anything its sad to say but what could i do by ripping them from the only home they do know and tell them its all wrong. i guess im not that selfless. and its like 12 kids. so that would be a lot. idk. but rightnow  i dont think so. just because im not in any way capable of taking care of them any better rightnow anyways. other than the not abusing them but whats worse?	0

Some weird  some eccentric  some rude  some polite. Its hard to put a definition on 'weirdest' and to pin a certain person down. Definitely some of the customers I meet are very weird (if I take it as the 'odd' interpretation)  for example  once I had 2 guys sat down in one of my tables  and one kept staring at me. It was a little offputting  so I tried to avoid them as much as I could. When I was putting their food down  a member of staff (a guy) said bye to me  gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek. The guy on my table  stood up  eyed him with the worst look as my friend walked out. He then looked at me and said &quot;he doesn't appreciate your eyes. He looks about 12  pshhhhh&quot;  then sat down and ate. LOL!!! Thats just one weirdo  I meet a lot :P	0

Q: would you change your (last) name if you got married?  would you rather that your partner changed her (last) name? or keep things the same?<br>A: This is annoying it didn't appear :( How many others aren't appearing too :'( Anyway  to re-answer :) I think its quite sad when you change your name  only because I see it (kind of) as a way that you are giving up on your family and ditching them for a new one. BUT  I also see it as a wonderful way  when you gain someone elses name  because you are being accepted into your loved ones family  and thats awesome <3 So to solve all  I actually like double barreled names :) You don't give up your own  but you still gain your loved ones. Its like bringing both families together  rather than dropping or gaining  you get both :) How about you?	0

Q: how comes you don&#039;t sleep?<br>A: Well  a little while ago  I started chatting online  and I was always up until very late hours of the morning speaking to them  only because I wanted to  no other reason. Well  I did it  continuously for several months  and now  whenever I try to go to bed earlier  (even if im absolutely shattered) I just can't get to sleep :( My sleeping pattern is REALLY messed up  and although I wouldn't go back to change it  I still need to sort something out  but I don't know what. I have been to the doctors about it  several times  and the final time  he eventually perscribed me some medication. Thing is  it was a pretty heavy dose of something that was VERY addictive and caused a lot of bad side effects. I started to take them  and they didn't make ay difference at all. I finished the packet  and they made no change to my sleeping that there wasn't a point in continuing and getting hooked on anything dangerous. So all in all  im pretty screwed :( I go to bed  perhaps 3am  but I don't get to sleep until about 5/6am and im normally woken up not long after with my family leaving to go to work. So I go back to sleep  im woken again  and this continues until I actually get up a few hours later.  I think this needs to be sorted :( I need my life back :'(	0

Q: Why do people more commonly skip breakfast than any other meal  considering that this is the time when the stomach is emptiest?<br>A: Well  I for one  never really feel that hungry when I wake up. I sleep at odd times (because of my insomnia) so when I get up  I normally wait until about 2ish and have a bit of toast which lasts me for breakfast and lunch. Here's my theory. When you get hungry  if you don't actually eat anything  after a while you start to go past it  and I for one  lose my appetite altogether. So here's my thinking. You are asleep overnight  thus losing your appetite whist you are asleep  then waking up having gone past it  and are no longer hunger? What do you think?	0

Q: What do you do  when you fall for someone who would never feel the same?<br>A: It depends  you have to ask yourself; is there a chance we could ever be something? If the answer is yes  then thats a good start. You need to get to know that person and then go from there.  If the answer is &quot;not a chance!&quot; then  its really shit  but you need to stop yourself from falling any harder than you already have. I know its hard to do  and its much easier for someone else to say &quot;get over them&quot; because its a fucking hard thing to do! To get over someone  especially when you have fallen hard  it really hurts  but you need to catch it before it ends up getting worse. You know? If you know there definitely isn't a chance between you  and you know that you are ready for a relationship  its probably best to find someone else and concentrate your feelings on them instead. If you are willing to let your feelings (for the other person go)  involving yourself with someone can let them melt away. Anyway  its never easy  and to persue them can be an easier way out  but it all depends on how strong you are  and the person you have fallen for. Okay  essay answer. Good luck :)	0

Recycling  planting flowers and smiling at people just because I want to make their day! :] He's perfect for me. He understands me in every aspect a man could. Hes sweet enough to damper my attitude and sarcasm at times but bullheaded enough to not always give in to me. Lets me whine if I want attention and holds me more than I could ever want to be held. I love him. And for me  hes my perfet guy! <3r Ohh and he's a super sexxy stud :] of course.	0

Q: describe... your garden?<br>A: Hmmm  my Garden. Well it has 2 sections to it.  It starts off with a pond and a patio area  then the first section is long and narrow (ish) and goes all the way to a square shapped holey trellace thing. Its all covered in grass  but then around the edges are flower beds and trees. If you go to the end of the garden and turn left  there is more kind of around the corner  behind our garage. Then it goes onto a raised patio platform thing with a swing chair thing and it goes a little more along the back (length ways). That doesn't make ANY SENSE! Here :) lol http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=11088742&amp;id=750810466 It goes on a bit longer  and goes around the corner a little at the top and bottom.

Q: I still cant believe you know Georgia... and you&#039;ve met the skins cast... :-O anyone else i should know about? who was your favorite to meet? who was the nicest(&amp;who wasnt)? who was absolutely nothing like you expected them to be like? who was the cutest?<br>A: Ummm  I don't think so lol. Saw Simon Cowell about a month ago. Ermmmm  the nicest people? Well I am obviously biased  but I think I would Say Lily  with Kat close behind :) Lily is SOOOO down to earth  and I Really could imagine myself being good friends with her in real life. As for Kat  she was lovely too  but Kat has a VERY cool exterior  and because she gets a REAL lot of people talking to her  she has a lot to deal with  you know what I mean? When I met Kaya  I didn't actually like her. Both times :( the first time  I was outside the cinema  and Luke  Kat  Lily and Kaya were just going in. I called out &quot;Kat!&quot; and she looked around  really shocked! LOL! Then I spoke to them  and Kaya shouted &quot;come on! The film has already started!&quot; and Lily followed her inside the theater. Luke and Kat were stood there  and we were all just looking at each other  not knowing what to do. I said &quot;don't worry. ITs okay  enjoy your film&quot; and Both Luke and Kat looked at each other  replying &quot;no no no&quot; and walked back over to me :D I LOVED IT! That was SUCH a nice feeling! Knowing they were missing their film to come and talk to me! So anyway  I spoke to Luke first  then I started talking to Kat and Luke went on inside. Then I was saying how much I loved Emily  etc etc etc (crazy fangirl behaviour lol) and she said thanks  did a cute thumbs up thing  I said bye  and she did a cute wave. She was adorable then! Anyway  the second time I met Kaya  it was at the Skins House. She had been in the VIP area upstairs ALL night  and she had just come down  for about 5 minutes. I saw her  and walked over asking for a photo. She was talking to someone  so I just stood there and patiently waited. Then she stopped  and I tapped her on the shoulder. Nothing. So she started talking to someone else. I waited until she finished  and tapped again. Nothing. Then she started talking again  I waited  tapped again. Nothing. So I started saying &quot;kaya?&quot;  nothing. Said it again  nothing :( Then she started to walk away  up some stairs  back into the VIP room  and she was running up pretty fast so I couldn't follow :( Later on  I saw her again  and I asked her to sign my magazine cover. She said yes  and then she had just signed a 'k' and then someone walked into her  causing her to smudge the pen/marker. At this point  she hasn't even signed half her name  but she just said 'sorry' and walked off  leaving me stood there with a magazine with the entire cast's signatures on  and a 'k' over Kaya's photo. I wasn't too impressed if im honest  especially because I wasn't being pushy :( anyway  I did eventually manage to get a quick photo with her  but it was a bit of a job to get there :( Hmm  the cutest? Probably Meg :) She has quite low self asteem actually! When I met her at the filming  she was just sat by herself  watching the filming. Then we went over and started chatting to her  and she was saying how she had been there 10 hours and they hadn't even used her in anything yet :( Then we had a photo with her  and looking back at it  she was like &quot;OMG! I look terrible!&quot; even though she looked adorable :) Then there was when I met her at the house party. She was pretty sweet then too. I think she was a bit nervous actually because in the beginning  she was walking around holding Lukes hand and it was just so sweet to see :) Then  she went outside and was smoking practically the entire night lol. She was a drowned little rat! She was drenched! But still looked adorable :)	0

Q: tell me your life story?<br>A: Oh god! Okay  ready for an essay from me this time? :P  So  I was born. Which I don't remember  otherwise that would have been a sight! I open my eyes  to see and hear &quot;pushhhhhhhhh&quot; and a little slit with light coming through-ahem! I shall start a little later :P  I went to primary school  and all through the 6 years  I was such a good girl  and I was even encouraged by a teacher to do something wrong because I saw so innocent.  I got bullied pretty badly through the years 4-6 and eventually I started to stick up for myself towards the end  so they dropped it and left me alone. I won :D Anyway  In year 6 I had my first (and little did I know  last) crush on a boy. I told my mum  and she got really excited that i was 'growing up'. Well  this crush was really big (or at least I thought it was at the time) and I Remember at our end of year prom thing  he asked me out. I got really embarrassed and I ended up saying no (which I kicked myself for in the end). I started secondary school  and my parents wanted me to go to the school that my sister goes to. It is SUCH a good school  but I refused because all my friends were going to my local one  and I wanted to go with them. Well I started school fine  and got along really well with everyone. About a year later  the people who I went to school with  aka my friends from primary school  started to pick on me. It got really bad again  and I ended up having no one.  I met another friend  Laura and she helped me through everything. Eventually we became best friends  and the other group of friends now started to pick on her because she was friends with me. One day  I thought enough is enough  and I went to a teacher about the bullying. She phoned up both of our parents  and let them know what was happening. About a week later  once things had started to calm down a little  the girl who bullied me  her mum phoned up the school  saying that I was now bullying her! I was called into a meeting with the bully herself and another teacher to sort this out. This teacher was crap  and basically believed everything the other girl was saying  just because she was coming off &quot;sweet and innocent&quot;. My mum heard about this  and called up the bullys mum to have a chat with her. She came around our house  and was trying to pick a fight with my mum outside  all while I was listening to them argue while hiding under the stairs. She left  and my mum refused to engage in a fight over something that could be sorted without parental violence. Nothing was ever sorted  and I think the girl (the bully) got a little scared about being found out and her mums temper  that she finally left me alone. So  I was happy again :)  I finished secondary school pretty happy. I was top of most of my classes  and i even was entered into this british art competition by my art teacher  which I won :D I loved art at school  and every lunch and after school  my art teacher let us have her room so I could sit and carry on with my work. Because I loved it so much! she wouldn't let anyone else in their  except for me and my friends  because I was her no1 student :) Well  life was good until I started to become confused about my sexuality. I didn't think much about it at first  only that all my friends were talking about 'boys' and I couldn't agree or relate to anything that they were saying.  Well  I finished school really confused  and went onto college to study further subjects. I grew apart from my old friends  because being in a different college  with a different time table  its awkward to keep in touch so well as you were before. So I made a new circle of friends  and I got really close to one girl in particular. We became best friends  and told eachother everything. About 2 years after being friends  I decided I wanted to tell someone about me being gay  and thought she was the best person to tell. So  I told her  and almost instantly  she abandoned me :( We didn't really speak anymore  and I know it was because I freaked her out  and she didnt want to have a 'lesbian' as her best friend :(  So  I moved on and decided I didn't want to have a friend like her if something as small as sexuality would ruin our relationship. So anyway  I started my art foundation year  and I FUCKING LOVED IT!!! It was one of the best times of my life  and Idid love the end parts in particular. I went through that phase  of not being bothered to go  and I did take a bit of time off (usually to sleep on at home lol)  but I still came out with one of the best grades out of a couple of hundred people. So I was really proud :D  Anyway  once finishing that year  I didn't know what I wanted to continue on to university  so I decided to take a gap year  and build up a little money and sort my head out with what I actually wanted to do. in the year I was working for my parents a bit  property developing and stuff. The year turned into 2  and I kind of went astray from any dreams that I really wanted. Which is why I did something about it  got my ass in gear and applied to Brighton Film School. Well  I got in  as you know  and that pretty much leads me up to now :)  Soooo  I AM SO SORRY about this essay :P I hope you haven't fallen asleep  and I sincerely appologise if you have :( So  in response to yours  you don't have to apologise about it being long! and it wasn't boring  its interesting to hear everything that has gone on with your life.

Do you like to laugh ?? ..<br>A: A man walks up to the bar with an ostrich behind him  and as he sits  the bartender asks for their order.r r The man says  &quot;I'll have a beer&quot; and turns to the ostrich. &quot;What's yours?&quot; &quot;I'll have a beer too&quot; says the ostrich.r The bartender pours the beer and says &quot;That will be $3.40 please &quot; and the man reaches into his pocket and pays with the exact change for payment.r r The next day  the man and the ostrich come again  and the man says &quot;I'll have a beer &quot; and the ostrich says &quot;I'll have the same.&quot; Once again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change.r r This became a routine until late one evening  the two enter again. &quot;The usual?&quot; asks the bartender.&quot;Well  it's close to last call  so I'll have a large Scotch&quot; says the man. &quot;Same for me&quot; says the ostrich. &quot;That will be $7.20&quot; says the bartender. Once again the man pulls exact change out of his pocket and places it on the bar.r r The bartender can't hold back his curiosity any longer. &quot;Excuse me  sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?&quot;r r &quot;Well &quot; says the man  &quot;several years ago I was cleaning the attic and I found this old lamp. When I rubbed it a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever needed to pay for anything  I just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money will be there.&quot;r r &quot;That's brilliant!&quot; says the bartender. &quot;Most people would wish for a million dollars or something  but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!&quot;&quot;That's right! Whether it's a gallon of milk  or a Rolls Royce  the exact money is always there &quot; says the man.r r &quot;That's fantastic!&quot; says the bartender. &quot;You are a genius! ... Oh  one other thing sir  what's with the ostrich?&quot;r r The man replies  &quot;Oh  my second wish was for a chick with long legs.&quot;	0

Q: What do you think about men who hit women?<br>A: I think it's no different than a woman to hit a man than a man to hit a woman  first of all.

He's gotta make up for something else if he feels the need to take advantage of a being thats smaller and weaker that themselves or thier own. r r Hence don't think im not a feminist like all other strong figured  well headed  a female can do anything a man can do  but lets face reality and we can't. So when it comes down to it  theres nooo reason a male should ever hit another female. Ever.	0

Q: Who the hail is Richard Aldington?<br>A: Richard Aldington is probably best known for being one of the first three Imagist poets  along with Ezra Pound and H.D. Around the Fall of 1912 in London  Pound proclaimed himself and his two good friends to be the three original Imagists  and was instrumental in getting the early poems of Aldington and H.D. published in Poetry Magazine (edited by Pound's friend Harriet Monroe in Chicago). The three poets established a set of principles to guide their writings. Pound recorded them in &quot;A Retrospect&quot; (Literary Essays of Ezra Pound. London: Faber &amp; Faber  1954): r r r In the spring or early summer of 1912  'H.D.'  Richard Aldington and myself decided that we were agreed upon the three principles following:r 1. Direct treatment of the 'thing' whether subjective or objective.r 2. To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation.r 3. As regarding rhythm: to compose in the sequence of the musical phrase  not in the sequence of a metronome. r r yes i stole it from google so shoot me	0
Q: Is there a such thing as a perfect relationship for you?<br>A: Ummm  I think the term 'perfect relationship' varies for everyone and anyone depending on their mood at the time. You know?

Someone who gets you  who unterstands your feelings and needs  and treats you with the respect you treat them with. Someone romantic  cute  witty  honest  trusting etc lol. how about you?	0

Q: Would you rather spend life in prison or be executed?<br>A: Probably prison. Prisons today are actually getting better :) I mean  say you didn't have any money  and it meant you were going to be living on the streets  and homeless for however long that took. I would go and commit a crime that enabled me to go to prison. Nothing to hurt anyone  but perhaps a robbery or something where I intended on getting caught lol. It has to be better in there than living on the streets. Anyway  this wasn't the question....Prison. Just because  I don't think it is that bad in there. I mean yeah  I can't really know  not properly  but aside from being beaten up (perhaps) it can't be too bad. Better than being dead lol. If not  then just try something and kill yourself :S lol!	0

Q: independent but you live at home... explain?<br>A: Well I am independent in the sense that I don't care what other people think (about certain things anyway) and I don't let anything else influence what I wear or say.  A lot of people say my dress sense is &quot;unique&quot; and I would agree lol. I still live at home  only because I have no other choice. Im only 20  and you will see what its like to be still pretty young and not have the biggest income. If I moved out  I would be paying rent for somewhere  but I couldn't even afford to live. So whats the point in moving out? I will in time  well in september. So its going to be a nice break :) When I am at home  im independent in the sense that I like to be in my bedroom or by myself doing things (not that Im a loner lol) I just find it easier to concentrate on something if no one else is there. You know what I mean? I sound completely weird don't I??? O_O lol!	0

Q: How many in your family? How many siblings do you have? Are you the oldest or the youngest of those siblings?<br>A: I actually have a really small family. In my close family  its me  my sister (who is 23) and our parents. Then I have one gran  2 uncles  one aunt and 2 cousins. Although I hardly see both of my uncles  they aren't really bothered about keeping in contact with the family  so eventually we have sort of lost touch :( I haven't seen one of my cousins for about 4/5 years. He got married  and ended up forgetting about his own family to move in on his wifes family and friends. So basically  that leaves my nan  cousin and aunt are the only people I really see. Its pretty sad :( My cousin  her dad (one of the uncles) also treated her really badly as a child (deliberately left her out of things  made her eat at a separate table over dinner  sent her to bed when she did nothing wrong  wouldn't let her go outside etc) so its another reason why the family don't worry about the uncle excusing himself from the family.  Both of my other grandparents have passed away :( Grampy when I was 3  Nan when I was 5 (and I still remember that :'() and 'Pop' (grandfather) when I was 15. So  a pretty small loose family unit I would say :(	0

Q: how does the UK school/education system work?? its different from the US... now this is a boring question...<br>A: Okay  so basically. When we start education (at about 4/5 years) we start primary school  which goes from reception  then year one  through to year 6 (all completed yearly). Then  we go to secondary school  starting in year 7 (age 10/11) all the way through to year 11 (15/16). In years 3  6 and 9  we complete 'SATS' which are like little test things determining how well we are doing in school. In year 11  we complete our GCSE's  which are the qualifications that a lot of employees look at when interviewing you. Then we finished school and go to college to study a-levels for 2 years  generally before people go onto university to study a chosen subject at age 17/18 for a final degree. How about yours? Its always confused me :P lol	0

Q: haha thanks and i LOVEDDDDDDDDDD reading your life story. it was truly fascinating.. and you sound like quite the student :-) and im happy to be considered a friend  gotta love making friends right?haha any plans for the future? something u rly wnt to do?<br>A: You loved reading it? Pshhh  was boring :P lol I think both of ours were a bit depressing  but thats the things that stick out most in life  so automatically we remember the sad things over the happier things. Its how our minds work :) Hmmm  future plans. Well apart from wanting a family  and to be happily in love with a successful home and car etc etc As for career plans  my ultimate goal would be to direct independent horror films :) I love how some of them can contain so much art (visually) as they can video. When I say independent  I mean things like &quot;The Descent&quot;  &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot;  &quot;28 Days Later&quot; etc etc. Im not so much into big budget epic Hollywood movies  because it takes the essence out of capturing a moving image on film. They rely too much on special effects nowadays  and I prefer the retro approach to film making :)	0

Q: your Certificates-which takes 2 years to get  Masters-another 2 years  and PhD/Doctoral-another 2 years.. :-)people typically start college at age 18 and are done college by age 22 but then there is grad-school..so yea..loads of stuff  haha its so weird<br>A: HAHA! Yeah  we start college at 16  and then finish at 18  to go to university and usually come out about 21/22 with your degree depending on what you major in. Most degrees are 3 years  but if you wanted to be a Vet or a Doctor or a Surgeon etc  its about 6/7 years. Completely depends on the course :) The course im doing in september  basically gives me the equivilent of a degree  but in one year. Then I have the access to continue for another year  (making it a total of 2) to gain a masters in motion picture production  and the area I specialised in. So  Film School can definitely be a quicker route through education  but it is a lot more intense.	0

I don't use any straightners or curlers on it (very often anyway) I just let it do its thannnnng :) Probably why it is in such good condition then :) I style it occasionally obviously  but more often than not  its left messy :) But like styled messy  not like  trampy or anything LOL!	0

Q: opinion on s4 emily? naomi?<br>A: Hmmm  well I think Naomi deserves everything that she is getting  especially seeing as she isn't doing anything to win Emily back. She cheated on her  said &quot;I'll do anything&quot; then that was it. There wasn't any making Emily feel special  she was just moping about :S BUT  I think they both need to talk it out now. I think  with Emily  its going too far and they just need to sort it out  even argue it out  but at least get things said and out in the open. They are trying to act as though things are fine  even though both of them know it isn't. I think it is driving them both insane  and perhaps thats why Emily is looking at Mandy  maybe as a way out? I know for sure they are going to sort everything out  but I am disappointed it is going to be so late in the series :(	0

Q: What is the worst prank that has been pulled on you?<br>A: my parents turned the lights out on my sister and i when we watch the newest Texas Chainsaw Masacare in Theaters.

My dad crawled in the window.... all the lights off. he made the breaker trip...and we heard cracking floor noises in the kitchen..about shit our pants. all i had was a hanger and thought if anyone had to do anything it'd be me....r So of course i finally made myself around the corner of our room and the lights came back on....not too much later there was nocking on our window and like the dumb crazy person in the movie that you wanna scream at for not just leaving the window alone  i threw up the blinds to see my Dad's face plastered up against the window and hands up scaring me half to death!!!

Q: Worst thing someone has ever done to you?<br>A: Ummm  its hard to pin point things. I don't really know if im honest.

So I suppose  putting in loads of effort to something  and it not being appreciated is a slap in the face :(	0

Q: Why is &quot;Charlie&quot; short for &quot;Charles&quot; if they are both the same number of letters?<br>A: Because Charlie is also short for charlotte  and time for a story I think...  Once upon a time  there was a young girl called Charlotte. She was a pretty little girl  and everyone loved her. only one problem is  she had a great love for sports and all things male. She came out to her parents as being gay  and they wouldn't tolerate such a thing! So  they sent her to the nearby hospital and attached...pieces  and removed....bits.  She comes out  or is it still a she? His parents decided to cure the 'gay' issue  by changing her into a boy. Her former name  Charlotte had to be changed  and by rule of easiness  they changed it to Charles  so her former nickname would still be of use (they didn't want to change her name again  costing them more by deed poll). Charlie lived happily ever after  marrying the woman of his dreams... The end :)	0

Q: Should your partner also be your best friend?<br>A: I think its important yes  BUT it is also important to have a close friend outside the relationship. Just because if anything ever happened and you went through a 'rough patch'  sometimes other people can make you see things clearer. So  I think they can  but to have someone else outside the relationship is even more important.	0

We were sat eating them in the cafeteria  and people started throwing their chips at us  so my friends started throwing them back  but I refused to join in because I didn't want to get into trouble. Anyway  after much persuasion from my friends  I decided to throw ONE chip to get them off my back. I did  and guess what happened? The teacher saw me  NO ONE else  just me  and I got sent to detention for a week. I was so pissed! lol! Everyone found it funny bar me. Not good...lol	0

Take Naomily for example  Emily kissing that girl  it showed Naomi (in a really small sense) how Emily is feeling  even though it doesn't compare  Emily blatantly did it on purpose to get back at her  and I would probably do the same in her position. So  yes  I think it can be :)	0
Q: i miss you already... and its only been an hour...<br>A: Awwwww! I miss you too :( Im going to miss you lots today too  seeing as I have the crapfest of waitressing tonight :'''( Come and save me? Thanks :D Ohhh  and I had another dream last night! Which  I am glad to say you weren't in this one :S It was HORRRRRRRIBLE!!!!!!!!  So  it started off  I was in this really historic City  something like Prague  and I was with my sister. We saw this dog running around  crying out because half of its belly's skin had been ripped off!!! IT had blood ALL over it  but no one could catch the dog to take it to the vets. Anyway  I eventually managed to get it  and my sister (trainee vetinary nurse) was taking a look at him. Then I saw a manager from work  and I don't know how  but I just knew that he had done it. I spoke to him  and he was like &quot;I found this machine  that latches on to a piece of skin  then you pull the handle and it rips it off&quot;. I went HYSTERICAL and was asking what the fuck he thinks he was doing.  So then I ended up at home somehow  and the dog was at the vets Im guessing (i don't know where it went) and then I was reading up about this machine. It said that people who work nights  they used this machine on them (to remove all their skin) so that they weren't able to work in the day  and so outside people could tell the difference between night and day workers (WTF?!?!?!?!) lol. So anyway  I was really freaked out that my manager was going to come and get us (because I lost it on him about the dog) and I told my family  but they didn't really seem to believe me. So time went on  and I was sat in my room  and my sister and mum were randomally led in my bed  really scared. My manager got into the house and eventually attacked my mum. I lost it and grabbed a massive kitchen cake knife thing. I lunged at him  and started attacking his arms to get him to let go of my mum. He did  then he started trying to stab me  all while I kept slicing his arms with this knife. Eventually I went for it  and I slashed his throat!!! He didn't stop  so I had to do it again  a bit deeper. That still didn't stop him  so I started sawing at his neck to cut his head off. Nothing. He was still cutting my arms with his knife thing  so I kicked him to the floor and pushed down all of my weight onto the blade and eventually cut his head clean off!!!! Then he started laughing (even though his head was detached) and said about a bomb that he planted would be going off right about now and we had no time to get out. So we lost. I had a &quot;SHITTTTTT!&quot; moment  and me and my dad were trying to get my family out of the house  then I woke up....So im guessing I would have exploded??? O_O So yeah  im glad you weren't in that one :) Can I have a hug please? That wasn't nice :'''''''(	0

So  the next day  I got down this polystyrene head thing that I had  drew eyes on it with eyeliner  and pulled out this fake black wig I had from a fancy dress thing and dressed the wig with it. I then pulled out a floaty white dress thing that I had in my wardrobe  and kind of draped it over the head  making it look like a person. I then hung the head up  in a really odd angle in my parents cupboard under the stairs. When my mum came home  I called her and asked her to get me a bottle of drink from the cupboard  and she said yes. Me and my dad were waiting for the scream  and she returned with the bottle of drink  having not made a sound. Me and my dad were stunned  and asked her if she had seen &quot;it&quot;. &quot;Seen what?&quot; she replied....total and utter fail....lol	0

Q: In your opinion  what is the best thing about being a girl? :-)<br>A: Ummm  probably kind of the same as the last answer  in a weird way. Sensitivity? Only because  being a girl and someone doing something for you  either a friend  family member or a lover  you appreciate it so much more. Also  being a girl (this is going to sound terrible) but you are able to handle things better  and are able to understand how a certain person is feeling or thinking  and you can react to it in the right way. If that makes sense? Men  again some  not all  are less sensitive  and don't understand why that person is crying or angry  but being a girl. You just know :)	0

Q: hahah man gigglez?! i think it was kinda girly<br>A: soooo  ur a gay man?	1
Q: Would you rather be good looking or rich?<br>A: Good Looking I think. Just because being rich can attract the wrong crowd all together! I wouldn't want to be popular because of my money and I know there are crowds that are drawn to that. I would rather be popular for being me  and being good looking certainly adds to that. There was something on the TV I watched once  and they said that better looking people are more likely to be employed for a job than uglier ones. This is because  when they see someone who is attractive in how they dress  hair etc  it shows they are self caring and someone who doesn't take much effort in their appearance  could show that they aren't willing to give much effort in that field of work. It was scientifically proven  but I think its bullshit really lol  or should be at least :)	0

Q: Think of the last time you were REALLY angry<br>A: Work today! :( A group of 5 guests walked out without paying their bill  and I wasn't around at that precise moment to stop them  so they left  getting off scott free. I spoke to my manager  and he said that  &quot;they are my responsibility so I need to pay the bill with my own money&quot;. The bill was u00a380  and they were having a laugh if they thought I was paying that with my own cash! I can't keep an eye on my tables 100% of the time  because 99% of the time  I am doing things for them  which do involve walking to other areas of the restaurant. So anyway  this sparked a huge argument between me and my manager  and I wasn't backing down  and giving in resulting in myself being out of pocket. It was out of my control  and the company generates so much money  so why should they use their staff to continue generating profits? Well  I was SO SO SO angry  and I eventually went to the staff toilets to have a little cry due to the frustration of the situation.  It was sorted in the end  and because I didn't back down and agree to give it to them  they let it go lol. Like they should have too!	0
