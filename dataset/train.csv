Q: I still cant believe you know Georgia... and you&#039;ve met the skins cast... :-O anyone else i should know about? who was your favorite to meet? who was the nicest(&amp;who wasnt)? who was absolutely nothing like you expected them to be like? who was the cutest?<br>A: Ummm  I don't think so lol. Saw Simon Cowell about a month ago. Ermmmm  the nicest people? Well I am obviously biased  but I think I would Say Lily  with Kat close behind :) Lily is SOOOO down to earth  and I Really could imagine myself being good friends with her in real life. As for Kat  she was lovely too  but Kat has a VERY cool exterior  and because she gets a REAL lot of people talking to her  she has a lot to deal with  you know what I mean? When I met Kaya  I didn't actually like her. Both times :( the first time  I was outside the cinema  and Luke  Kat  Lily and Kaya were just going in. I called out &quot;Kat!&quot; and she looked around  really shocked! LOL! Then I spoke to them  and Kaya shouted &quot;come on! The film has already started!&quot; and Lily followed her inside the theater. Luke and Kat were stood there  and we were all just looking at each other  not knowing what to do. I said &quot;don't worry. ITs okay  enjoy your film&quot; and Both Luke and Kat looked at each other  replying &quot;no no no&quot; and walked back over to me :D I LOVED IT! That was SUCH a nice feeling! Knowing they were missing their film to come and talk to me! So anyway  I spoke to Luke first  then I started talking to Kat and Luke went on inside. Then I was saying how much I loved Emily  etc etc etc (crazy fangirl behaviour lol) and she said thanks  did a cute thumbs up thing  I said bye  and she did a cute wave. She was adorable then! Anyway  the second time I met Kaya  it was at the Skins House. She had been in the VIP area upstairs ALL night  and she had just come down  for about 5 minutes. I saw her  and walked over asking for a photo. She was talking to someone  so I just stood there and patiently waited. Then she stopped  and I tapped her on the shoulder. Nothing. So she started talking to someone else. I waited until she finished  and tapped again. Nothing. Then she started talking again  I waited  tapped again. Nothing. So I started saying &quot;kaya?&quot;  nothing. Said it again  nothing :( Then she started to walk away  up some stairs  back into the VIP room  and she was running up pretty fast so I couldn't follow :( Later on  I saw her again  and I asked her to sign my magazine cover. She said yes  and then she had just signed a 'k' and then someone walked into her  causing her to smudge the pen/marker. At this point  she hasn't even signed half her name  but she just said 'sorry' and walked off  leaving me stood there with a magazine with the entire cast's signatures on  and a 'k' over Kaya's photo. I wasn't too impressed if im honest  especially because I wasn't being pushy :( anyway  I did eventually manage to get a quick photo with her  but it was a bit of a job to get there :( Hmm  the cutest? Probably Meg :) She has quite low self asteem actually! When I met her at the filming  she was just sat by herself  watching the filming. Then we went over and started chatting to her  and she was saying how she had been there 10 hours and they hadn't even used her in anything yet :( Then we had a photo with her  and looking back at it  she was like &quot;OMG! I look terrible!&quot; even though she looked adorable :) Then there was when I met her at the house party. She was pretty sweet then too. I think she was a bit nervous actually because in the beginning  she was walking around holding Lukes hand and it was just so sweet to see :) Then  she went outside and was smoking practically the entire night lol. She was a drowned little rat! She was drenched! But still looked adorable :),0

Q: Who the hail is Richard Aldington?<br>A: Richard Aldington is probably best known for being one of the first three Imagist poets  along with Ezra Pound and H.D. Around the Fall of 1912 in London  Pound proclaimed himself and his two good friends to be the three original Imagists  and was instrumental in getting the early poems of Aldington and H.D. published in Poetry Magazine (edited by Pound's friend Harriet Monroe in Chicago). The three poets established a set of principles to guide their writings. Pound recorded them in &quot;A Retrospect&quot; (Literary Essays of Ezra Pound. London: Faber &amp; Faber  1954): r r r In the spring or early summer of 1912  'H.D.'  Richard Aldington and myself decided that we were agreed upon the three principles following:r 1. Direct treatment of the 'thing' whether subjective or objective.r 2. To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation.r 3. As regarding rhythm: to compose in the sequence of the musical phrase  not in the sequence of a metronome. r r yes i stole it from google so shoot me,0

Thanks :D Ohhh  and I had another dream last night! Which  I am glad to say you weren't in this one :S It was HORRRRRRRIBLE!!!!!!!!  So  it started off  I was in this really historic City  something like Prague  and I was with my sister. We saw this dog running around  crying out because half of its belly's skin had been ripped off!!! IT had blood ALL over it  but no one could catch the dog to take it to the vets. Anyway  I eventually managed to get it  and my sister (trainee vetinary nurse) was taking a look at him. Then I saw a manager from work  and I don't know how  but I just knew that he had done it. I spoke to him  and he was like &quot;I found this machine  that latches on to a piece of skin  then you pull the handle and it rips it off&quot;. I went HYSTERICAL and was asking what the fuck he thinks he was doing.  So then I ended up at home somehow  and the dog was at the vets Im guessing (i don't know where it went) and then I was reading up about this machine. It said that people who work nights  they used this machine on them (to remove all their skin) so that they weren't able to work in the day  and so outside people could tell the difference between night and day workers (WTF?!?!?!?!) lol. So anyway  I was really freaked out that my manager was going to come and get us (because I lost it on him about the dog) and I told my family  but they didn't really seem to believe me. So time went on  and I was sat in my room  and my sister and mum were randomally led in my bed  really scared. My manager got into the house and eventually attacked my mum. I lost it and grabbed a massive kitchen cake knife thing. I lunged at him  and started attacking his arms to get him to let go of my mum. He did  then he started trying to stab me  all while I kept slicing his arms with this knife. Eventually I went for it  and I slashed his throat!!! He didn't stop  so I had to do it again  a bit deeper. That still didn't stop him  so I started sawing at his neck to cut his head off. Nothing. He was still cutting my arms with his knife thing  so I kicked him to the floor and pushed down all of my weight onto the blade and eventually cut his head clean off!!!! Then he started laughing (even though his head was detached) and said about a bomb that he planted would be going off right about now and we had no time to get out. So we lost. I had a &quot;SHITTTTTT!&quot; moment  and me and my dad were trying to get my family out of the house  then I woke up....So im guessing I would have exploded??? O_O So yeah  im glad you weren't in that one :) Can I have a hug please? That wasn't nice :'''''''(,0

Q: Think of the last time you were REALLY angry<br>A: Work today! :( A group of 5 guests walked out without paying their bill  and I wasn't around at that precise moment to stop them  so they left  getting off scott free. I spoke to my manager  and he said that  &quot;they are my responsibility so I need to pay the bill with my own money&quot;. The bill was u00a380  and they were having a laugh if they thought I was paying that with my own cash! I can't keep an eye on my tables 100% of the time  because 99% of the time  I am doing things for them  which do involve walking to other areas of the restaurant. So anyway  this sparked a huge argument between me and my manager  and I wasn't backing down  and giving in resulting in myself being out of pocket. It was out of my control  and the company generates so much money  so why should they use their staff to continue generating profits? Well  I was SO SO SO angry  and I eventually went to the staff toilets to have a little cry due to the frustration of the situation.  It was sorted in the end  and because I didn't back down and agree to give it to them  they let it go lol. Like they should have too!,0

I think there can be what is described as a very strong connection  but I dont think it is instantly love. I could never love someone without knowing their personality first  so  for me.

Most degrees are 3 years  but if you wanted to be a Vet or a Doctor or a Surgeon etc  its about 6/7 years. Completely depends on the course :) The course im doing in september  basically gives me the equivilent of a degree  but in one year.

Well  I did it  continuously for several months  and now  whenever I try to go to bed earlier  (even if im absolutely shattered) I just can't get to sleep :( My sleeping pattern is REALLY messed up  and although I wouldn't go back to change it  I still need to sort something out  but I don't know what. I have been to the doctors about it  several times  and the final time  he eventually perscribed me some medication. Thing is  it was a pretty heavy dose of something that was VERY addictive and caused a lot of bad side effects. I started to take them  and they didn't make ay difference at all. I finished the packet  and they made no change to my sleeping that there wasn't a point in continuing and getting hooked on anything dangerous. So all in all  im pretty screwed :( I go to bed  perhaps 3am  but I don't get to sleep until about 5/6am and im normally woken up not long after with my family leaving to go to work. So I go back to sleep  im woken again  and this continues until I actually get up a few hours later.  I think this needs to be sorted :( I need my life back :'(,0

Q: tell me your life story?<br>A: Oh god! Okay  ready for an essay from me this time? :P  So  I was born. Which I don't remember  otherwise that would have been a sight! I open my eyes  to see and hear &quot;pushhhhhhhhh&quot; and a little slit with light coming through-ahem! I shall start a little later :P  I went to primary school  and all through the 6 years  I was such a good girl  and I was even encouraged by a teacher to do something wrong because I saw so innocent.  I got bullied pretty badly through the years 4-6 and eventually I started to stick up for myself towards the end  so they dropped it and left me alone. I won :D Anyway  In year 6 I had my first (and little did I know  last) crush on a boy. I told my mum  and she got really excited that i was 'growing up'. Well  this crush was really big (or at least I thought it was at the time) and I Remember at our end of year prom thing  he asked me out. I got really embarrassed and I ended up saying no (which I kicked myself for in the end). I started secondary school  and my parents wanted me to go to the school that my sister goes to. It is SUCH a good school  but I refused because all my friends were going to my local one  and I wanted to go with them. Well I started school fine  and got along really well with everyone. About a year later  the people who I went to school with  aka my friends from primary school  started to pick on me. It got really bad again  and I ended up having no one.  I met another friend  Laura and she helped me through everything. Eventually we became best friends  and the other group of friends now started to pick on her because she was friends with me. One day  I thought enough is enough  and I went to a teacher about the bullying. She phoned up both of our parents  and let them know what was happening. About a week later  once things had started to calm down a little  the girl who bullied me  her mum phoned up the school  saying that I was now bullying her! I was called into a meeting with the bully herself and another teacher to sort this out. This teacher was crap  and basically believed everything the other girl was saying  just because she was coming off &quot;sweet and innocent&quot;. My mum heard about this  and called up the bullys mum to have a chat with her. She came around our house  and was trying to pick a fight with my mum outside  all while I was listening to them argue while hiding under the stairs. She left  and my mum refused to engage in a fight over something that could be sorted without parental violence. Nothing was ever sorted  and I think the girl (the bully) got a little scared about being found out and her mums temper  that she finally left me alone. So  I was happy again :)  I finished secondary school pretty happy. I was top of most of my classes  and i even was entered into this british art competition by my art teacher  which I won :D I loved art at school  and every lunch and after school  my art teacher let us have her room so I could sit and carry on with my work. Because I loved it so much! she wouldn't let anyone else in their  except for me and my friends  because I was her no1 student :) Well  life was good until I started to become confused about my sexuality. I didn't think much about it at first  only that all my friends were talking about 'boys' and I couldn't agree or relate to anything that they were saying.  Well  I finished school really confused  and went onto college to study further subjects. I grew apart from my old friends  because being in a different college  with a different time table  its awkward to keep in touch so well as you were before. So I made a new circle of friends  and I got really close to one girl in particular. We became best friends  and told eachother everything. About 2 years after being friends  I decided I wanted to tell someone about me being gay  and thought she was the best person to tell. So  I told her  and almost instantly  she abandoned me :( We didn't really speak anymore  and I know it was because I freaked her out  and she didnt want to have a 'lesbian' as her best friend :(  So  I moved on and decided I didn't want to have a friend like her if something as small as sexuality would ruin our relationship. So anyway  I started my art foundation year  and I FUCKING LOVED IT!!! It was one of the best times of my life  and Idid love the end parts in particular. I went through that phase  of not being bothered to go  and I did take a bit of time off (usually to sleep on at home lol)  but I still came out with one of the best grades out of a couple of hundred people. So I was really proud :D  Anyway  once finishing that year  I didn't know what I wanted to continue on to university  so I decided to take a gap year  and build up a little money and sort my head out with what I actually wanted to do. in the year I was working for my parents a bit  property developing and stuff. The year turned into 2  and I kind of went astray from any dreams that I really wanted. Which is why I did something about it  got my ass in gear and applied to Brighton Film School. Well  I got in  as you know  and that pretty much leads me up to now :)  Soooo  I AM SO SORRY about this essay :P I hope you haven't fallen asleep  and I sincerely appologise if you have :( So  in response to yours  you don't have to apologise about it being long! and it wasn't boring  its interesting to hear everything that has gone on with your life. I would consider you as a friend too  so that means I want to know about everything :D,0

Do you like to laugh ?? ..<br>A: A man walks up to the bar with an ostrich behind him  and as he sits  the bartender asks for their order.r r The man says  &quot;I'll have a beer&quot; and turns to the ostrich. &quot;What's yours?&quot; &quot;I'll have a beer too&quot; says the ostrich.r The bartender pours the beer and says &quot;That will be $3.40 please &quot; and the man reaches into his pocket and pays with the exact change for payment.r r The next day  the man and the ostrich come again  and the man says &quot;I'll have a beer &quot; and the ostrich says &quot;I'll have the same.&quot; Once again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change.r r This became a routine until late one evening  the two enter again. &quot;The usual?&quot; asks the bartender.&quot;Well  it's close to last call  so I'll have a large Scotch&quot; says the man. &quot;Same for me&quot; says the ostrich. &quot;That will be $7.20&quot; says the bartender. Once again the man pulls exact change out of his pocket and places it on the bar.r r The bartender can't hold back his curiosity any longer. &quot;Excuse me  sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?&quot;r r &quot;Well &quot; says the man  &quot;several years ago I was cleaning the attic and I found this old lamp. When I rubbed it a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever needed to pay for anything  I just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money will be there.&quot;r r &quot;That's brilliant!&quot; says the bartender. &quot;Most people would wish for a million dollars or something  but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!&quot;&quot;That's right! Whether it's a gallon of milk  or a Rolls Royce  the exact money is always there &quot; says the man.r r &quot;That's fantastic!&quot; says the bartender. &quot;You are a genius! ... Oh  one other thing sir  what's with the ostrich?&quot;r r The man replies  &quot;Oh  my second wish was for a chick with long legs.&quot;,0

I think  with Emily  its going too far and they just need to sort it out  even argue it out  but at least get things said and out in the open. They are trying to act as though things are fine  even though both of them know it isn't. I think it is driving them both insane  and perhaps thats why Emily is looking at Mandy  maybe as a way out? I know for sure they are going to sort everything out  but I am disappointed it is going to be so late in the series :(,0

Q: What do you think about men who hit women?<br>A: I think it's no different than a woman to hit a man than a man to hit a woman  first of all.

He's gotta make up for something else if he feels the need to take advantage of a being thats smaller and weaker that themselves or thier own. r r Hence don't think im not a feminist like all other strong figured  well headed  a female can do anything a man can do  but lets face reality and we can't. So when it comes down to it  theres nooo reason a male should ever hit another female. Ever.,0

Q: How many in your family? How many siblings do you have? Are you the oldest or the youngest of those siblings?<br>A: I actually have a really small family. In my close family  its me  my sister (who is 23) and our parents. Then I have one gran  2 uncles  one aunt and 2 cousins. Although I hardly see both of my uncles  they aren't really bothered about keeping in contact with the family  so eventually we have sort of lost touch :( I haven't seen one of my cousins for about 4/5 years. He got married  and ended up forgetting about his own family to move in on his wifes family and friends. So basically  that leaves my nan  cousin and aunt are the only people I really see. Its pretty sad :( My cousin  her dad (one of the uncles) also treated her really badly as a child (deliberately left her out of things  made her eat at a separate table over dinner  sent her to bed when she did nothing wrong  wouldn't let her go outside etc) so its another reason why the family don't worry about the uncle excusing himself from the family.  Both of my other grandparents have passed away :( Grampy when I was 3  Nan when I was 5 (and I still remember that :'() and 'Pop' (grandfather) when I was 15.

When I say independent  I mean things like &quot;The Descent&quot;  &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot;  &quot;28 Days Later&quot; etc etc. Im not so much into big budget epic Hollywood movies  because it takes the essence out of capturing a moving image on film.

Q: In your opinion  what is the best thing about being a girl? :-)<br>A: Ummm  probably kind of the same as the last answer  in a weird way. Sensitivity? Only because  being a girl and someone doing something for you  either a friend  family member or a lover  you appreciate it so much more. Also  being a girl (this is going to sound terrible) but you are able to handle things better  and are able to understand how a certain person is feeling or thinking  and you can react to it in the right way. If that makes sense? Men  again some  not all  are less sensitive  and don't understand why that person is crying or angry  but being a girl. You just know :),0

It was a little offputting  so I tried to avoid them as much as I could. When I was putting their food down  a member of staff (a guy) said bye to me  gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek. The guy on my table  stood up  eyed him with the worst look as my friend walked out. He then looked at me and said &quot;he doesn't appreciate your eyes. He looks about 12  pshhhhh&quot;  then sat down and ate. LOL!!! Thats just one weirdo  I meet a lot :P,0

Q: Why is &quot;Charlie&quot; short for &quot;Charles&quot; if they are both the same number of letters?<br>A: Because Charlie is also short for charlotte  and time for a story I think...  Once upon a time  there was a young girl called Charlotte. She was a pretty little girl  and everyone loved her. only one problem is  she had a great love for sports and all things male. She came out to her parents as being gay  and they wouldn't tolerate such a thing! So  they sent her to the nearby hospital and attached...pieces  and removed....bits.  She comes out  or is it still a she? His parents decided to cure the 'gay' issue  by changing her into a boy. Her former name  Charlotte had to be changed  and by rule of easiness  they changed it to Charles  so her former nickname would still be of use (they didn't want to change her name again  costing them more by deed poll). Charlie lived happily ever after  marrying the woman of his dreams... The end :),0

If anything  it went slightly backwards  only because it cleared up things from the first one  that would have been nice left to the imagination... :(,0
