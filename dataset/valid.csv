We suddenly had this MAD rush of people through the door  and it got really busy. Thing is  I was the only member of staff on  and my manager wasn't turning anyone away  so I was running the whole restaurant by myself. I think I was about to faint in my dream  because of the stress of everyone yelling at me for something to do  that I woke up lol. Then I fell back to sleep rather quickly and went back into it :'( Anywayyy...that doesn't count I take it :P  Well I argue with my family a lot  and I don't really get on with my father. So  we are ALWAYS arguing over things  and it really gets me down. We had a massive argument on tuesday night about something (he treats my sister differently  better  even though she is the one that causes all the trouble). This argument got VERY heated  and I ended up being stuck in my room ALL night  completely starving and thirsty but I wasn't going out to face him lol.,0

Q: how does the UK school/education system work?? its different from the US... now this is a boring question...<br>A: Okay  so basically. When we start education (at about 4/5 years) we start primary school  which goes from reception  then year one  through to year 6 (all completed yearly). Then  we go to secondary school  starting in year 7 (age 10/11) all the way through to year 11 (15/16). In years 3  6 and 9  we complete 'SATS' which are like little test things determining how well we are doing in school. In year 11  we complete our GCSE's  which are the qualifications that a lot of employees look at when interviewing you. Then we finished school and go to college to study a-levels for 2 years  generally before people go onto university to study a chosen subject at age 17/18 for a final degree. How about yours? Its always confused me :P lol,0

Q: dream car/bike/van?<br>A: HAHA! Your answer to this question made me laugh! The car that I really wanted  (before I settled with mine) was a 5 dr Toyota Rav 4 :P In light metallic blue with grey bumpers! Made me laugh that we wanted the same one lol!  So anyway  my dream car  do you mean affordable or in a dream world? I will say both :) If money wasn't an option  I would probably choose something like a porshe Carrera GT Cabriolet  only because <333333333 But in the real world  I am happy to say I own my dream car :D A New Beetle Cabriolet. I have it in light metallic blue and have blue and white flowers/birds down the side. If I could change the colour  I would. I LOVEEEEEEE the dark metallic navy one  with the cream leather. I would actually jizz if I ever bought one like that! LOL! It costed me just over u00a37 000 and that was a lot of money for me having just turned 19  but I saved up and managed to get it :) The insurance is a bitch though  but luckily its fairly economical to run :) I also really wanted to own a Jeep Wrangler Golden Eagle in Black  but they came out last year I think  and its far too much money for me to spend on a car.

Q: What do you do  when you fall for someone who would never feel the same?<br>A: It depends  you have to ask yourself; is there a chance we could ever be something? If the answer is yes  then thats a good start. You need to get to know that person and then go from there.  If the answer is &quot;not a chance!&quot; then  its really shit  but you need to stop yourself from falling any harder than you already have. I know its hard to do  and its much easier for someone else to say &quot;get over them&quot; because its a fucking hard thing to do! To get over someone  especially when you have fallen hard  it really hurts  but you need to catch it before it ends up getting worse. You know? If you know there definitely isn't a chance between you  and you know that you are ready for a relationship  its probably best to find someone else and concentrate your feelings on them instead. If you are willing to let your feelings (for the other person go)  involving yourself with someone can let them melt away. Anyway  its never easy  and to persue them can be an easier way out  but it all depends on how strong you are  and the person you have fallen for. Okay  essay answer. Good luck :),0
